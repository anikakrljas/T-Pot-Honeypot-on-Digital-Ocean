# 🐝 T-Pot Honeypot Setup on Digital Ocean ☁️
Introduction

Welcome to my T-Pot Honeypot project! 👋

T-Pot is an all-in-one honeypot platform that combines multiple honeypot technologies to capture and analyze attacks in real-time. It is widely used for research and security monitoring to understand attacker behaviors and techniques. 🔒

I decided to deploy T-Pot on Digital Ocean, a cloud computing platform that provides simple and scalable virtual machines (Droplets) to host applications. Digital Ocean makes it easy to set up a server quickly without worrying about hardware management. ⚡

🛠 Creating a Droplet
1. Go to Create Droplet

Start by logging into your Digital Ocean account and click on Create → Droplet.
This will open the page where you can configure your virtual machine.

2. Choose an Image

Select the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS image, which is recommended for T-Pot installation.
This image will serve as the operating system for your droplet.

3. Choose a Region

Pick a region closest to your location for better latency. This ensures faster connections when accessing your droplet.
